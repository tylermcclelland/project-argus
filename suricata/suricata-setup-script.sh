# This script is to help you quickly install suricata on your Debian OS 
# (tested on Rasberry Pi running Raspberry Pi OS or Raspbian)
#
# The method of install is based on the official suricata documentation and
# the following youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrT64MH2CIM


# making sure you're system's up to date
echo "Ensuring system is up do date..."

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

#actual Suricata install
echo "Installing Suricata..."

# used by debian package install in suricata docs, youtube video used 'sudo apt install suricata -y'
# not sure if that matters, noting for potential debugging 
# TODO: remove comment after verifying it doesn't matter
sudo apt-get install suricata -y
